Screening Assessment  
 
The purpose for the screening is to determine the program that you qualify for  according to the Arizona 
Department of Health Services (ADHS) standards . A.B.C. screeners are qualifie d under ADHS licensing 
standards with additional qualifications and experience . Complete, true and accurate information must be 
disclosed to ensure the program you attend will be accepted by the state and the court. False or inaccurate 
information can bring more court action, screening, programs and fees.  
 
For DUI Clients Only  
A.R.S. 28 -1381 requires each DUI offender to complete an individual screening and program. The 
proper program is identified by the screening process according to ADHS rules . The DUI screening 
agency and program provider MUST be licens ed by ADHS as a DUI service provider.  
 
An assignment to attend AA meetings may be used in conjunction with an education/treatment 
program . AA cannot  be used instead of a program because it is not licensed  by the State of Arizona.  
 
MVD review s their files  before license reinstatement  to determine if an appropriate level of 
education and/or treatment was prescribed an d completed. Any  discrepancies that  indicate the 
information you provided  was inaccurate or incomplete  may require you to be re -evaluated and/or  
participate in an addit ional program. Y ou will be responsible for all additional fee requirements. 
Therefore, it is recommended that you provide complete and accurate information to the screener.  
 
A separate MVD evaluation will be required if your license  was revoked and not suspended.  
 
For Domestic Violence Clients Only  
Arizona Department of Health Services rules require a minimum of 26 treatment sessions for  a 
first time domestic violence offense, 36 sessions for a second domestic violence offense, 52 se ssions 
for a third domestic violence offense.  
 
Program Referrals  
 
All program referrals must be completed as required under Arizona Statute and ADHS regulations. Failure to 
complete the program referral will result in a non -compliance issued to the referri ng agency/court. Also, 
license reinstatement may be withheld until proof of completion is provided.  
 
Requirements for Out -of-State Program Attendance  
Obtain approval from ABC before starting any program by submitting the following: The Agency name, 
address  and phone number; A copy of the state license or syllabus with license number printed; A program 
description including the number of sessions, the number of hours in each session, an outline of topics 
covered; A contact person (including name, phone numbe r, and fax number); A release of information form; 
You must verify attendance by submitting monthly progress reports, and complete the program by submitting 
a discharge summary and/or completion certificate.  
 
Screening Grievance Procedure  
 
It is our goal t o provide you with the most accurate and appropriate placement that satisfies the state and court 
requirements and reinstatement of your license if your charge is a DUI.  
 
If you disagree with your screening or would like additional information, please call  (602) 788 -1116 between 
8:00am and 5:00pm, Monday through Friday. Request our of fice to review your file. If  this does not clarify

Volunteer Client Services  
 
Arizona Behavioral Counseling (ABC) will provide services to individuals who are voluntarily seeking screening or 
program services. These services may be used for compliance with another state or agency, and/o r to meet MVD 
requirements for a DUI citation.  ABC will provide the volunteer with proof of all services completed.  
 
Out of State/ Out of Agency Volunteers  
 
A volunteer is completely responsible for notifying their referring   agency of completion and ABC w ill not 
guarantee the agency’s acceptance of the service unless  the client requests ABC to contact the referring agency to 
determine the exac t requirements. In order to have the ABC service verified for acceptance  by the outside agency , 
the following is re quired from the client:  
 
a. Sign a release of information allowing ABC to contact and review the circumstances of your case with the 
referring agency.  
b. Pay a $40  processing f ee, and ABC will contact the outside agency about their requirements and notify the 
volunteer of the results.  ABC  will notify the outside agency of completion.   
 
If a volunteer clie nt chooses to schedule a service, ABC will document the client as a volunteer and  if the out of 
state agency has been  contacted.  
 
AZ MVD Screening Volunteers  
 
Arizona State requires that each client must attend a screening/asses sment for  any DUI offense to determine the 
appropriate program or level of care. Clients will be given a copy of the screening report. MVD screening  results 
will be sent to MVD electronical ly.  
 
MVD clients who attend the screening with ABC, but choose an outside agency for their  program, will have their 
outside agency report the program completion to MVD (ABC reports the screening completion, but it is the outside 
agency’s responsibility to  report the program completion).
